*change variable names to all lowercase (if it's easier, separate with "_") 
	* use the "rename" command -- e.g. say: [rename Country country] --> put this in the do file that cleans/lables variables

*Work with Melissa to create a variable that is equal to 1 if the traial was in the US (at all) -- let's call it "us_trial" 
	* Need to create a separate text variable that includes all of the strings of country names in "Country"
	* Figure out if "US" (or any other version of that -- e.g. "United States" or "USA" or "U.S.") are in there
	* Create a variable that is a flag for whether the trial has any of these strings in it
	* Merge that variable (us_trial) back onto the main data set and it should be binary:-) 
	* Eyeball/spot check it against "Country" when you have the variable done! 
	
*Create indicators (dummies) for different Phase 2 flavors
	* e.g. gen phase2 = Phase == " Phase 2 Clinical" ... etc!
	* note: you can also use the command encode to create a numeric indicator from strings, but let's not use that here! 

	
*For down the road: 
	* work with Melissa to create a whole bunch of dummy variables that apply to all of the crazy conditions listed:
	* this will probably involve outsheetign the condition string data, parsing it (delimited by ";" which helps), coding individual conditions as dummies
	* Separately, we will want to do the exact same exercise with all of the biomarkers
	* These tasks will likely have a large "by hand" component to them, which will be a pain in the butt, but this is super important!
	* Melissa will know how and where to automate as much of this as possible! 
	
*For PrimaryInterventions:
	* more simply to start with: see if the word "alone" is in the string: if so, this is a single therapy trial...if not, it is a combination therapy trial
	* generate a dummy called "combination_therapy" if the string "alone" is NOT in the primary intervention text. 
	
*Note: we may want to return to the recruitment stats and organization type variables later and use them...nothing to do now, just note this! 	
*Later: deal with coding category variable
