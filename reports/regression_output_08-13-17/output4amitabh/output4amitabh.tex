\section*{Notes}
\begin{enumerate}

\item In Tables 1-4, the models estimated in columns 4 and 8 are the same as those estimated in 3 and 7, respectively, the key difference being (4) and (8) are estimated with standard errors clustered at the level of most common ICD-9 chapter. 

\item Columns listed as \textit{All} include all Phase I-III trials since 1995 while \textit{Recent} include only trials since 2005.

\item Marginal effects cannot be reported for interaction terms but are reported for models including interactions.

\item Start year fixed effects are estimated in Table 5-6 Columns 1-3, but are not reported because of mechanical relationship with the outcome variable (trial duration). Column 4 reports the linear trend in duration by trial start year, but this is also mechanically linked to duration in that all observed trials have an upper bound on their observed actual end date (the date data was collected). Therefore recent trials with observed durations will be shorter on average than trials that began earlier.

Some trials have estimated dates after the date of data collection, but the meaning of these dates is somewhat unclear. Table 5 includes trials with actual or estimated end dates while Table 6 subsets to only actual end dates.

Removing estimated-date trials does not seem to radically change the pattern of results, but R-squared does increase substantially indicating much of the unexplained variation in duration may be due to measurement error.
